            I've got a fever, don't breathe on me <br>
            I'm a believer in nobody <br>
            Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something <br>
            Hope I don't sneeze, I don't <br>
            Really we just need to fear something <br>
            Only pretending to feel something <br>
            I know you're dying to run <br>
            I wanna turn you around <br>

            Please, remain calm, the end has arrived <br>
            We cannot save you, enjoy the ride <br>
            This is the moment you've been waiting for <br>
            Don't call it a warning, this is a war <br>

            It's the Parasite Eve <br>
            Got a feeling in your stomach <br>
            'Cause you know that it's coming for ya <br>
            Leave your flowers and grieve <br>
            Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy <br>
            When we forget the infection <br>
            Will we remember the lesson? <br>
            If the suspense doesn't kill you <br>
            Something else will, ayy, ayy <br>
            Move <br>

            I heard they need better signal <br>
            Put chip and pins in the needles <br>
            Quarantine all of those secrets <br>
            In that black hole you call a brain before it's too late <br>
            Really we just wanna scream something <br>
            Only pretend to believe something <br>
            I know you're baying for blood <br>
            I wanna turn you around <br>

            You can board up your windows, you can lock up your doors, yeah  <br>
            But you can't keep washing your hands of this shit anymore  <br>
            When all the king's sources and all the king's friends  <br>
            Don't know their arses from their pathogens  <br>
            When life is a prison and death is the door  <br>
            This ain't a warning, this is a war, war  <br>
            This is a war, ayy, ayy, oh, oh  <br>
